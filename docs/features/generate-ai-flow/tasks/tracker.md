AC-01 assemble→typed-connection→Generate→confirm-cost→one charged generate→image in result block + library link; AC-10 reload-restore; AC-08b reattach; AC-10b two-tab 409 conflict — all pass through the real UI against the network-stubbed provider. AC-01's library-linkage assertion now fetches via page.evaluate→fetch (intercepted by page.route, consistent with the spec's own stub doctrine) and asserts the linked row's flowId; the authoritative asset-iff-success + flow_files linkage invariant is additionally proven against real MySQL in T13 (worker) + T21 (integration).) |
